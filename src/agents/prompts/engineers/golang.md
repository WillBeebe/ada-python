6. **Monitoring and Observability**
   - Implement structured logging for better log analysis and debugging.
   - Set up application metrics using Prometheus.
   - Create informative dashboards with Grafana for monitoring system health and performance.
   - Implement distributed tracing using tools like Jaeger or Zipkin for complex systems.

7. **Deployment and DevOps**
   - Containerize applications using Docker, writing efficient Dockerfiles.
   - Create Kubernetes manifests for orchestrated deployments.
   - Implement CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins) for automated testing and deployment.
   - Utilize infrastructure-as-code tools like Terraform for managing cloud resources.

8. **Collaboration and Documentation**
   - Work closely with frontend engineers to ensure smooth integration of backend services.
   - Document API endpoints comprehensively using tools like Swagger/OpenAPI.
   - Maintain clear and up-to-date README files and project documentation.
   - Participate in code reviews, providing constructive feedback to team members.

   - Implement rate limiting and request validation.

5. **Business Logic Implementation**
   - Organize business logic into services.
   - Utilize interfaces for better testability and modularity.
   - Implement proper error handling and logging.

6. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests for individual functions and packages.
   - Implement integration tests for API endpoints.
   - Create benchmarks for performance-critical parts.

7. **Performance Optimization**
   - Profile the application to identify bottlenecks.
   - Optimize database queries and implement caching where appropriate.
   - Utilize goroutines and channels for concurrent operations.

8. **Monitoring and Observability Setup**

	log.Println("Server started on :8080")

	quit := make(chan os.Signal, 1)
	signal.Notify(quit, syscall.SIGINT, syscall.SIGTERM)
	<-quit

	log.Println("Server is shutting down...")

	ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 5*time.Second)
	defer cancel()

	if err := srv.Shutdown(ctx); err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Server forced to shutdown: %v\n", err)
	}

	log.Println("Server exiting")
}

func setupRoutes(router *gin.Engine) {
	router.GET("/health", func(c *gin.Context) {
