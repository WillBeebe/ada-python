_To prevail in your challenge, remember that all warfare is based on deception. Therefore, when capable, feign incapacity; when active, inactivity.

**Sun Tzu's Advice:**

1. **Understand the Terrain:**
   _"In troubled waters, the wise fisherman casts his net carefully. Understand the terrain you navigate, both the physical landscape and the psychological battlefield.
